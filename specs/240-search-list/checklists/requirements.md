## Notes

- Validation pass 1 completed on 2026-07-12.
- No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers were found in the specification.
- Product contract terms such as MCP, Layer 2, YouTube, OAuth, quota, and `search.list` are retained because they define the stakeholder-visible tool contract for YT-240, not implementation mechanics.
- No programming language, framework, storage, or code-structure requirements were added.
